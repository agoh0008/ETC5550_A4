# ETC5550: Assignment 4

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 4 of the ETC5550 unit (Applied Forecasting).

The assignment involves modifying a function to generate data from an `ARIMA(p,0,q)` model with parameters specified by the user. This includes checking for stationarity and invertibility conditions, and ensuring that the initial values do not affect the generated series by discarding the first few observations. The modified function should be able to simulate time series data based on given AR and MA coefficients.
